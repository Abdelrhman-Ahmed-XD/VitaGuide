        supplementGuidance: "Most individuals meet their needs through diet alone. Supplementation may be considered in confirmed deficiency, malabsorption disorders, or for medically supervised cholesterol management. Dosage forms include immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, sustained-release tablets, and over-the-counter capsules. To improve tolerance: take with meals to reduce flushing, avoid alcohol and hot beverages near dosing time, and consider extended-release forms taken at bedtime with a light snack. Aspirin may reduce flushing (only under medical advice). Niacin (nicotinic acid) causes flushing; niacinamide does not. High-dose therapy requires liver function monitoring.",
        whenToSeeDoctor: "Seek medical evaluation if you experience persistent rash or digestive symptoms, ongoing fatigue, confusion or memory problems, symptoms of overdose, or no improvement after dietary correction. Skin rash with diarrhea and confusion is an emergency — classic pellagra presentation.",
